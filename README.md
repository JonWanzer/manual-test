# manual-test
A test manual document 

This is a test document to pass a manual / proceedural to Discord using webhooks.

So, it looks like we can get authorized by the ARRL-VEC for remote testing. We have some hoops to jump through, but it is doable. All we need physically to do remote sessions is a computer, Zoom, and a web browser. 

There are several steps to getting things going. It is complicated because it is a new thing and documentation is not in place so I have put together some links to get us going.

1) Sign up on https://hamstudy.org 
I recommend using your callsign as the username, in fact, I recommend using it for all of these registrations.

2) Sign up on https://hamstudy.dev 
They look the same but they are not, and you will need both.

3.A) Sign up for Discord https://discord.com/ 
3.B) Download the application, phone or desktop, the desktop is easier to work with while you get started.

You will need Discord. Communication with the HamStudy development team and getting authorized is all done through Discord.

The name of the Discord server you want is: Amateur Radio Volunteer Examiners of America

4) In the # public channel scroll to the bottom and you will find a Google Docs "VE Discord Sign-Up" link. There are several links, go to the bottom. Click on that and fill out the form.

Once you have filled out that form you will want to message to someone in the Experienced Support team back on Discord. 

5) Look on the right side of Discord where the user names are and see if any of the Experienced Support team has a green dot on their avatar. If you see one, message them directly using @[and their name] and tell them:
    you are a VE, 
    you have signed up on the .org and .dev sites
    you have filled out the Google Docs form
    also, let them know that your team lead is already set up and wants to do sandbox training so you need access to the sandbox

They will walk you through the rest of getting set up. They need to do some verifications. Having all of these things done in advance should speed up the process. 
If I missed something, or said something incorrect please let me know. I want to turn this into a procedural document.

If you are at a stop and wait point, they have done some video training on youtube. The videos are pretty short. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxsQ4bjUNnppBmsjEE9vad-ZuQonD8Bp

Let me know when you have access as a VE.

Once we have done all of this and have at least one sandbox session done as a team, I can contact Marea at the VEC for final approval and she will put us on the remot authorized list. Once she has done that we will be given live access on HamStudy.

It is a process, I know. It is a lot of stuff to do, but once it is all done the rest will be a breeze.

Thank you for being a VE and a part of this team. I appreciate you all more than you know.

Let me know if you have any questions.
